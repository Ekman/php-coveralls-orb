  Run PHPUnit tests and upload code coverage as one job. This will also report PHPUnit tests to CircleCI and upload artifacts.
  More straight forward approach but it expects an environment where Composer and PCOV/Xdebug is already installed. PHPUnit
  is not a must and you can use your own tool to generate clover coverage file.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    php-coveralls: nekman/php-coveralls@1
    composer: stockfiller/composer@2
    phpunit: stockfiller/phpunit@1
  workflows:
    foo:
      jobs:
        - php-coveralls/generate_upload:
            clover-path: coverage/clover.xml
            generate-steps:
              - phpunit/test:
                  test-path: tests
                  src-path: src
                  coverage: clover
                  coverage-path: coverage/clover.xml
